# Kibana
Thanks Portefaix

[Alpine Linux][] is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox.
This image is based on the official Alpine Linux.

[Kibana][] is an open source data visualization platform.
Port exported is : `5601`

## Usage

You could check *elasticsearch* on : `http://localhost:9200` and Kibana running on `http://localhost:5601/status`

Don't use tag :base OK ? :-)
